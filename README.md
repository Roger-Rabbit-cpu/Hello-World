I Have found something (ie- Coding, Linux) justto name a few that i find really intresting and love spending my spare time Lurning and enhandcing my skills as much as i can, and as many ways as i can. Wheather it be online or Magazines/Books when iam away from the laptop. I might be a bit slow Lurning things but the one thing with me when i have found something i realy like im persistant and don't give up trying!! (This is proberly about the thrid to forth time for me doing this) on different Accounts and emails whitch i lose accsess to by my own stuipity LOL. So fingers crossed this is the winner!
